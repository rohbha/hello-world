Learning GitHub

Hello World!

My name is Rohil. I have advanced knowledge in Java and, although rusty, Python, as well. I have intermediate knowledge of HTML/CSS and R. I briefly used MatLab over the summer. I am interested in using GitHub to aid in my learning of Android App Development.

This repository and file is merely to help me learn GitHub better.
